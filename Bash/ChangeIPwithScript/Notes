Start

    Using SED AWK or GREP create a script that:

    Dynamically finds the first ethernet adapter on the systems

    Prints to the screen the current state of the adapter (static or dhcp)

    Prints to the screen the current IP, subnet, gateway, dns

    Asks if I want to set the adapter to DHCP or STATIC

    If static asks for input for IP, Sub, GW, and DNS

    Sets adapter and restarts network services

End
